# PrivOS Demo MCP App

This is the reference schema-v2 PrivOS MCP app. It demonstrates exact required and optional
permissions, safe feature degradation, secretless workload identity, authenticated private Hub
dispatch, the iframe host bridge, license-aware behavior, and reproducible Marketplace packaging.

## Runtime trust model

`@privos_ai/app-server`'s `resolveRuntimeMode()` picks exactly one of three modes, in this
precedence, and never guesses:

1. **`managed`** — a workload identity socket is present (App Cluster mounts one per
   installation). No pair URL, OAuth client secret, or browser user token is ever used.
2. **`standalone-production`** — a paired standalone identity file is present (see
   [Standalone production](#standalone-production-self-hosted-against-a-standalone-hub) below).
3. **`development`** — neither is present, and `NODE_ENV` is not `production`.

Both a workload socket and a paired identity file present is a fatal startup error (stale state
from a prior deployment mode, or a misconfigured host — never silently picked). `NODE_ENV=production`
with neither is also a fatal startup error: there is no unsigned-production fallback in any mode.

In `managed` mode, App Cluster mounts a per-installation Unix socket. `@privos_ai/app-server`
creates an ephemeral P-256 DPoP key in memory, obtains short-lived sender-constrained workload
tokens through the socket, and refreshes them without writing credentials to disk or environment
variables. Hub-to-app `/mcp` requests travel through private Cluster dispatch and carry a
short-lived signed assertion bound to the request body, installation, replica, receipt hash, and
permission epoch. The backend actor for `hr_whoami` comes from that verified assertion. The iframe
receives only non-secret host context and uses `app.rest()`, `app.uploadFile()`, and MCP tools
through the Hub bridge as the current user.

Production accepts these non-secret values from the platform:

- `PRIVOS_HUB_ORIGIN`
- `PRIVOS_APP_ID`
- `PRIVOS_INSTALLATION_ID`
- `PRIVOS_WORKLOAD_SOCKET` (normally `/run/privos/identity.sock`)

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 22+, npm, Git, and Docker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrivOS-AI/privos-mcp-app-demo
cd privos-mcp-app-demo
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` resolves to `development` mode (no workload socket, no paired identity file) and
connects over the Relay WebSocket. Obtain a pairing URL from PrivOS Admin and paste it into the
prompt; credentials are cached to `.env` for the next run. This relaxed-compatibility path — an
unverified `hr_whoami` actor, credentials cached to disk — is only ever reachable when
`NODE_ENV` is not `production`; the SDK's mode resolver refuses `development` outright otherwise.

The Vite UI defaults to `http://localhost:5179`. `DEV_TUNNEL=cloudflared` is optional when the
browser displaying Hub is on another machine.

## Managed direct runtime

The Marketplace image starts Direct HTTP transport by default (`managed` mode once the platform
mounts `PRIVOS_WORKLOAD_SOCKET`; falls back to `development` mode locally when it isn't mounted):

```bash
npm run build
PORT=3000 npm start
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/ready
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/.well-known/mcp/manifest.json
```

Development compatibility reports manifest-verified readiness without a broker. In production,
`/health` only proves the process is alive; `/ready` returns 200 only after the manifest is valid,
workload identity is paired, and the current receipt/epoch is active. A public or unsigned
production `POST /mcp` returns 403.

## Standalone production (self-hosted against a standalone hub)

A publisher can also run this exact app against a portal-less, self-hosted Hub — same manifest,
same tools, same permission contract as a Marketplace install, but the app pairs directly with the
Hub over the Relay WebSocket instead of App Cluster mounting a socket. Direct HTTP `/mcp` has no
trust source in this mode and always returns 403 (`DISPATCH_ASSERTION_INVALID`); every MCP
dispatch rides the Relay connection with a mandatory Hub-signed assertion.

### Pair, twice

```bash
npm run pair     # or: pnpm pair
```

The command asks for the one-time pairing URL the Hub operator gives you — it takes no arguments,
so the URL never lands in your shell history. It then announces `privos-app.json` over the pairing
socket, which means no admin ever handles the manifest file: the app states what it wants, and an
admin decides what it gets.

Run it **twice**, because the two runs mean different things:

1. The first run REGISTERS the app. The Hub stores the announced contract, grants nothing, and
   reports `awaitingApproval`. No identity file is written and the app does not start — dispatch
   trust belongs to the generation an approved permission ceiling creates, and there is nothing
   to run until then. Approve the declared permissions in Hub Admin > Apps.
2. Run it again with a fresh pairing URL from that app's own settings. The Hub re-hands the same
   credentials plus its dispatch trust, the identity file is written, and **the app starts
   automatically** — `pair` continues into `start:standalone` through whichever package manager
   you invoked it with, so there is no second command to remember.

The identity file lands at `./privos-standalone-identity.json` (override with
`PRIVOS_STANDALONE_IDENTITY_FILE`) at mode `0600`, and the Hub's fingerprint is printed:

```
PrivOS Hub fingerprint: SHA256:<43-char base64url> — verify this out-of-band before trusting dispatch from this Hub.
```

**Verify this fingerprint out-of-band** — over a channel other than the one that gave you the
pairing URL (a phone call, a separately-verified chat, the operator's own documentation). The
fingerprint is the same SSH-host-key-style trust-on-first-use model as `ssh` printing a host key:
a compromised pairing URL could otherwise hand you a Hub that signs dispatch you'd wrongly trust.
Because the second `pair` run starts the app for itself, verify the fingerprint the moment it is
printed and stop the process if it does not match.

### Identity file handling

The identity file is the sole source of Relay OAuth credentials and Hub dispatch trust for this
mode — treat it like an SSH private key:

- Back it up. Losing it means re-pairing (a new pairing URL from the Hub operator); there is no
  recovery path from the file alone.
- Never commit it, `docker cp` it into an image, or log its contents. `scripts/package-source.sh`
  already refuses to package any `.env*` / credential-like file; keep this file out of the
  Marketplace source archive the same way.
- A re-pair attempt over an existing file refuses (`IDENTITY_FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS`) rather than
  silently overwriting it — remove the file first if you intend to re-pair from scratch.

### Run

The second `pair` run already started the app. Every later start — after a reboot, a redeploy, or
any ordinary restart — uses the identity file that pairing wrote, and needs no pairing URL:

```bash
npm run start:standalone
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/ready
```

`/ready` reports `not_ready` (503) with a specific `reason` — `IDENTITY_NOT_LOADED`,
`RELAY_NOT_AUTHENTICATED`, `MANIFEST_LINT_INVALID`, or `MANIFEST_DRIFT` — until the identity
loads, the Relay connection authenticates, and the locally-built manifest's canonical digest still
matches the digest pinned at pairing time.

### Verified caller identity over Relay

The Relay runtime-dispatch assertion (`SELF_HOSTED_LOCAL` / `PUBLISHER_HOSTED`) proves *which
installation* dispatched a call, but — unlike the managed Cluster assertion — carries no embedded
actor claim. `connectRelay` independently verifies a SEPARATE Hub-signed RS256 user token
(`_meta.privosUser.userToken`) against the Hub's published JWKS
(`/.well-known/mcp-apps/jwks.json`) and cross-binds its room claim to the already-verified dispatch
`roomId`. This is wired in automatically (`hubUserTokenAuth: 'auto'`, the default) whenever a Hub
dispatch trust is configured — true here, since `start:standalone` pins the paired identity's
trust — so `hr_whoami` reports a verified actor for `standalone-production` exactly like it does
for `managed`, with `provenance: 'user-token'` distinguishing it from the managed path's
`'dispatch-assertion'`.

This verification requires the app host to reach the Hub's JWKS endpoint over the network. A
fetch failure or timeout degrades that request's actor to unavailable (`hr_whoami` reports
`verified: false`) — it never crashes dispatch and never falls back to the plain, unverified
`_meta.privosUser.userId` / `username` fields that ride alongside the token.

`npm run dev` / `npm run start:relay` (`development` mode) intentionally configure no Hub dispatch
trust at all (see [Local development](#local-development) above), so this auto-wiring does not
apply there and `hr_whoami` stays unverified for every relay-transported call in that mode — by
design, not a gap.

### Rotation

The Hub can push secret rotation, trust rotation (re-key or a generation/manifest update), and
capability changes over the same authenticated Relay connection, each as an ES256-signed control
notification verified against the identity file's *currently* pinned Hub key before it is applied.
No operator action is required; the identity file is rewritten atomically (temp file + rename) in
place.

### Upgrade path (manifest changes)

`/ready` returns `MANIFEST_DRIFT` when the locally-built `privos-app.json` no longer matches the
canonical manifest digest pinned at pairing — this is the standalone analogue of the managed
image-label digest check. A manifest change (new tool, new permission, new env declaration) needs
re-approval: the Hub operator re-reviews the new manifest and pushes a trust rotation carrying the
new digest before `/ready` goes green again. There is no way to silently start serving traffic
under a manifest the Hub never approved.

Every signed exchange in this mode — dispatch assertions and control notifications alike — is
capped at a 30-second signature lifetime with zero verifier headroom (`exp - iat <= 30`, hard
capped even if the Hub asked for more). NTP-synchronized clocks on both the Hub and this app are a
hard requirement, not an optimization; `/ready`'s `RELAY_NOT_AUTHENTICATED` reason is the
observable symptom of clock skew large enough to fail verification.

## Permission contract

[`privos-app.json`](privos-app.json) is the canonical reviewed manifest. Each permission declares:

- required or optional;
- workspace/room context and user/background execution context;
- a stable feature identifier and publisher reason;
- deterministic degraded behavior for every optional permission.

Required permissions are locked during approval. Optional permissions start from the exact
approved subset and may be disabled later; Hub enforces the new epoch immediately. UI capability
checks only hide or explain features and are never the authorization boundary. See
[`SCOPES.md`](SCOPES.md) for the declaration-to-call-site map.

Run the shared linter to print the deterministic canonical manifest and publisher permission hashes:

```bash
npm run manifest:lint
```

Portal and Hub add the versioned authoritative permission catalog, data policy, and immutable image
digest when computing the final permission-contract hash.

## Installation-owned agent bot demo

The **Agent bot** tab demonstrates the split approval model for an app-owned execution identity:
workspace approval creates one bot for the exact parent installation, while separate Room approvals
allow joining that bot and reading its safe identity in the current Room. The Room actions accept no
Room, bot, or token selector; the Hub derives authority from the verified invocation and active Room
binding. Bot-key provisioning remains a separate Sandbox operation.

See [`src/ui/agent-bot-panel.tsx`](src/ui/agent-bot-panel.tsx) for the three tool calls,
[`privos-app.json`](privos-app.json) for their permission declarations, and
[`SCOPES.md`](SCOPES.md) for the approval rationale and degraded behavior.

## Isolated list, multi-user assignment demo

The **Isolated ASSIGNEE** tab demonstrates assigning several users at once to an item on an
isolated list. The field type that controls who can see an item is **`ASSIGNEE`**
(`apps/meteor/server/core-typings/IList.ts` in the Hub) — some older docs name `USER_SELECT` or
`MEMBER_SELECT` instead, but neither field type exists in the Hub; using either name will not
create a working assignment field. One `ASSIGNEE` field accepts a bare user-id string, a `{ _id }`
object, or an **array** of either, so a single field can hold several assignees
(`getAssignedUserIds`, `apps/meteor/app/api/server/lib/isolated-list-item-filter.ts:23-41`).

For an isolated list, the Hub shows an item only to the room owner/admin, the item's creator, and
whoever is listed in its `ASSIGNEE` field(s) (same file, the visibility check that consumes
`getAssignedUserIds`) — nobody else in the room. The demo runs, in order: `mcpapp.lists.create`
(`isolatedList: true`, caller must be room owner/admin) → `mcpapp.lists.addField` (type
`ASSIGNEE`) → `mcpapp.lists.createItem` → `mcpapp.lists.updateCustomField` (writes an array of
user ids) → `mcpapp.lists.getItems` (reads the item back and confirms every assigned id was
stored, not just the first one). See [`src/ui/assignee-demo-panel.tsx`](src/ui/assignee-demo-panel.tsx)
for the calls and [`src/ui/assignee-demo-helpers.ts`](src/ui/assignee-demo-helpers.ts) for the
pure id-list parsing tested in [`tests/assignee-demo-helpers.spec.ts`](tests/assignee-demo-helpers.spec.ts).

Scope: only the already-declared `lists:write` (optional, room owner/admin for the isolated-list
create step) and `lists:read` (required) — no new permission is requested.

**Argument shapes — checked against the Hub's own tool schemas** in
`apps/meteor/server/services/mcp-tool-handlers-lists.ts`:

| Tool | Arguments |
|------|-----------|
| `mcpapp.lists.create` | `roomId`, `name`, `key?`, `description?`, `isolatedList?`, `fieldDefinitions[]`, `stages[]` |
| `mcpapp.lists.addField` | `listId`, `name`, `type`, `fieldId?` |
| `mcpapp.lists.createItem` | `listId`, **`title`** (not `name`), `description?`, `customFields[]`, `stageId?` |
| `mcpapp.lists.updateCustomField` | `itemId`, `fieldId`, `value` |
| `mcpapp.lists.getItems` | `listId`, `offset?`, `count?`, `sortBy?`, `sortOrder?`, `stageId?`, `customFieldFilters[]?` |

The shapes come from the schema definitions; the end-to-end flow itself has **not** been run
against a live Hub (this sandbox has none), so treat the response shapes — as opposed to the
request shapes — as the part still worth confirming on a real installation.

**Verify isolation with two accounts** (manual, needs a real Hub installation):

1. As account A (room owner/admin), open this app in a Room and run the demo on the **Isolated
   ASSIGNEE** tab, entering account A's and account B's user ids (each account's id is shown on
   its own **Identity** tab).
2. As account B, open the same list. The item should be visible — B is an assignee.
3. As account C, a third room member who is not the room owner/admin, not the item's creator, and
   not listed in the ASSIGNEE field, open the same list. The item should **not** be visible.
4. Re-run `mcpapp.lists.updateCustomField` to remove C from nobody's assignment (or add C), and
   confirm C's visibility flips accordingly — this is what proves the ASSIGNEE field, not room
   membership, gates isolated-list item visibility.

## License behavior

The manifest declares a Free tier (50 records) and Pro tier (5,000 records plus `bulk-export`).
The backend calls `license.assert('bulk-export')` and `assertWithin('records', count)`. A lapsed Pro
license degrades to Free without deleting records.

Local Pro test:

```bash
PRIVOS_APP_LICENSE='{"tier":"pro","state":"active"}' npm start
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run preflight
npm run docker:build
```

Preflight validates schema v2, canonical hashes, documented call sites, Docker inputs, license
guards, safe source packaging, and the served manifest. Its versioned rules mirror Portal until the
Marketplace validation package is published.

## Safe source packaging

```bash
npm run package
```

This creates `dist-source/ai.privos.mcp-app-demo-2.0.0.zip` plus a SHA-256 provenance file from
Git-tracked source. It rejects dirty trees by default, credential-like files, `.env`, dependencies,
build output, and archives over 200 MiB. `--allow-dirty` is for local inspection only.

The multi-stage image installs only lockfile-pinned package inputs, runs as `node`, supports a
read-only root filesystem, and needs no production credential environment variables.

## Environment configuration

`privos-app.json` declares the values an operator supplies from Hub **Admin → Apps → Settings →
Environment**. The declaration is part of the digest-pinned manifest, so it is fixed per published
version; the Portal validates it at submission and the reviewer sees every secret the app asks for.

| Key | Required | Secret | Purpose |
|-----|----------|--------|---------|
| `HRM_COMPANY_NAME` | yes | no | Company name in the dashboard header. |
| `HRM_LOCALE` | no | no | BCP-47 locale for dates and currency; the app defaults to `en-US`. |
| `HRM_SMTP_PASSWORD` | no | **yes** | SMTP password for payslip mail. |

Two rules this app demonstrates, and every publisher should follow:

- **A required value never blocks installation.** The operator fills it in afterwards, so the app
  must start and report its own unconfigured state. `hr_whoami` returns `companyName: null` rather
  than refusing to run.
- **A secret is reported, never printed.** `hr_whoami` returns `smtpPasswordSet: true|false`. The
  value would otherwise travel through a room, which is precisely what the platform's write-only
  storage exists to prevent.

Applying values restarts the app container. The environment is read at start like any process
environment; there is no runtime config-fetch API.

### Variables the platform injects

`hr_whoami` also echoes what PrivOS injects, read through the SDK's `getPlatformContext()`:

```ts
import { getPlatformContext, publicUrlFor } from '@privos_ai/app-server';

const { publicUrl, accessMode } = getPlatformContext();
const iconUrl = publicUrlFor('/public/icon.svg');
```

`PRIVOS_PUBLIC_URL` is this app's own public origin and `PRIVOS_ACCESS_MODE` is `managed-runtime`
or `publisher-hosted`. Tool calls and interface requests do **not** arrive on the public origin —
those ride the signed broker dispatch on `/mcp`. Use it for public static media, webhook callbacks,
and OAuth redirect URIs. Both helpers are undefined-safe, so the app still runs where nothing is
injected.

## Privacy, support, and release

Marketplace review/build source remains publisher-confidential; buyer workspaces receive the
digest-pinned image. See [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md), [`TERMS.md`](TERMS.md), and
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Support is available through GitHub Issues or `dev@privos.ai`.
