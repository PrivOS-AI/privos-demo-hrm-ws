# `privos-app publish` Error Reference

Every failure the CLI surfaces carries a `code` (visible in `--json` `error`
events and in the human-readable message) and maps to one of the exit codes
in `SKILL.md`. This table is generated from the CLI's actual error sites
(`src/cli/commands/publish.ts`, `src/cli/lib/*.ts`) — do not hand-edit
without checking the source stays in sync.

## Manifest / packaging (exit 2 unless noted)

| Code | Cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `MANIFEST_INVALID` | `privos-app.json` fails structural lint | Run `privos-app lint` and fix the reported fields |
| `MANIFEST_IDENTITY_MISMATCH` | `name`/`version` differ between `privos-app.json` and `package.json` | Make both files agree exactly |
| `NOT_GIT_REPOSITORY` (exit 5) | `--cwd` is not inside a git repo, or has no commits | Publish from a committed git checkout |
| `DIRTY_TREE` | Uncommitted changes present, `--allow-dirty` not passed | Commit the intended files, or pass `--allow-dirty` deliberately |
| `CREDENTIAL_FILE_FOUND` | A `.env.*`, `.pem`, `.key`, `id_rsa*`, or `*credentials*` file is in the working tree | Remove or relocate the file outside the packaged tree |
| `GIT_ARCHIVE_FAILED` (exit 5) | `git read-tree`/`add`/`write-tree`/`archive` failed | Check the git error text printed alongside; usually a broken index or permissions issue |
| `INVALID_ZIP` | Produced archive has no valid ZIP central directory | Re-run; if it repeats, file a bug — not user-fixable |
| `MISSING_REQUIRED_ENTRY` | Archive is missing `privos-app.json` or `Dockerfile` at its root | Ensure both files are tracked (or present with `--allow-dirty`) at the repo root |
| `DENIED_PATH_IN_ARCHIVE` | Archive contains `node_modules`, `dist`, `dist-source`, `.git`, `.privos/skills`, `.env*`, `..` traversal, or credential-like paths | Remove those paths from the tree/`.gitattributes export-ignore` before packaging |
| `ENTRY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Archive has more than 20,000 entries | Reduce tracked files or exclude generated assets |
| `FILE_SIZE_EXCEEDED` | A single file exceeds 50 MB | Remove or externalize the oversized file |
| `TOTAL_SIZE_EXCEEDED` | Archive exceeds 200 MB total | Trim the packaged tree |
| `CANCELLED` (exit 5) | User declined the interactive confirmation prompt | Re-run and confirm, or pass `--yes` |

## Authorization (exit 3 unless noted)

| Code | Cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `LISTING_NOT_BOUND` (exit 2) | A publisher token was used but this listing has never had an interactively-approved first version | Run `privos-app publish` without a token once (browser approval) to bind the listing, then use the token for subsequent versions |
| `LISTING_UNRESOLVED` (exit 2) | The Portal could not resolve a listing from the manifest name | Pass `--listing <slug>` |
| `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` | The approver declined the request on the approval page | Confirm with the user this was intentional; re-run to request a new approval if not |
| `AUTHORIZATION_EXPIRED` | Nobody approved within the authorization's TTL (15 min) | Re-run `publish`; approve promptly this time |
| `AUTHORIZATION_CONSUMED` | The device code was already used to mint a grant | Re-run `publish` to request a fresh authorization |
| `PUBLISHER_TOKEN_INVALID` / `PUBLISHER_TOKEN_REVOKED` / `PUBLISHER_TOKEN_EXPIRED` (exit 4) | `PRIVOS_PUBLISHER_TOKEN` is malformed, revoked, or past its expiry | Generate a new token in Creator Studio (step-up required) and export it in the environment |

## Upload / version / submit (exit 2 unless noted)

| Code | Cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLISH_GRANT_EXPIRED` (exit 3) | The 60-minute grant expired mid-upload | Re-run `publish` to request a new approval; do not resume a stale grant |
| `PUBLISH_GRANT_MISMATCH` | Uploaded archive sha256 or manifest name/version does not match what was approved | Re-run `publish` from a clean state — do not edit the archive after approval |
| `VERSION_SEMVER_EXISTS` | This exact semver was already published for the listing | **Bump `version` in both `privos-app.json` and `package.json`**, then re-run |

## Post-submit states (exit 0 — informational, not failures)

`publish` waits up to 60 s after submit for the version to leave
`PREFLIGHT_PENDING`, then prints one of:

- **`PREFLIGHT_FAILED`** — the automated preflight scan rejected the archive
  itself (manifest/runtime problems found in the uploaded content). The CLI
  prints the findings verbatim (exit 2). Fix the flagged issue, bump the
  version, and re-run `publish`.
- **`PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED_INFRA`** — preflight cannot run because of
  Portal-side build infrastructure capacity/availability, not anything wrong
  with the submission (exit 0). Tell the user this is admin-side; no local
  action fixes it — wait and check Creator Studio later.
- **listing content incomplete** — a *different* gate than preflight: if the
  Creator Studio listing itself is missing required metadata (categories,
  screenshots, legal URLs), the submission can be accepted by the CLI but
  stall in human review because the listing page is incomplete. This is not
  a CLI error code — the CLI only packages and submits the version; finishing
  the listing's content is done in Creator Studio, not via `privos-app`.
- **`PREFLIGHT_PENDING`** (still pending after 60 s) or any other state —
  printed as-is with "follow up in Creator Studio". The CLI has no `status`
  command; all further review progress (`SCAN` → `AI_REVIEW` → human
  `APPROVE` → build) is tracked only on `client.privos.io`.
